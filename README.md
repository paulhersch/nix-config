# My NixOS configuration
This repo contains all the files needed to replicate my NixOS setup. nothing special, just a backup repo for myself.

## Installation
if you want to try out my config for some reason you would have to clone the repo, generate the hardware-config, move it to hosts and then add a nixosConfiguration for your hostname (basicall install like any other flake).

rebuild will take some time, depending on which part of the config is chosen a fresh download should be about 20 Gigabytes.

After that you will have a mostly working system install, no guarantees, i am garbage at this.
